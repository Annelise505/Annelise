  h1> The first iphone was announced and released on January 9, 2007.Apple created the device during a private collaboration with Cingular Wireless, now part of AT&T. The development cost of the collaboration was about $150 million in 30 months. The iPhone's back cover is made out of brushed aluminum, a soft metal. The iPhone's screen is a 320x480 resolution, multi-touch screen, that measures 3.5 inches diagonally. The rear camera on the iPhone has a resolution of 2 megapixels and features geotagging. The iPhone was released for the price of $499 for the 4 GB model and $599 for the 8 GB model. In 1984, said Jobs, Apple introduced the Macintosh and changed the computer industry. In 2001, the company introduced the iPod and changed the entire music industry. Key features include a 3.5-ince diagonal screen, 320x480 pixels at 163 ppi, and 2- megapixel camera. The original operating system for the original iPhone, iPhone OS 1, featured Visual Voicemail, multi-touch gestures, HTML email, Apple's Safari web browser, threaded text messaging, an "iPod" music and video player app, a dedicated YouTube app and a Maps app powered by Google Maps. It also included Phone/contacts, Calendar, Photos, Stocks, Weather, Clock, Calculator, Notes, and Settings apps. However, many features like MMS, apps, and copy and paste were not supported at release, leading hackers jailbreaking their phones to add these features.

     <p>The iPhone 13 Pro features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion, but its big draw is the inclusion of a Telephoto camera, in addition to the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras that come with the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini. It comes with a LiDAR scanner for Night Mode photography and offers a 1 TB model for more storage than any iPhone has ever offered before. It needs it, considering all the new camera features make for pretty bulky file sizes. It is also powered by the A15 chip and comes in silver, graphite, gold, and sierra blue. The iPhone 13 Pro Max offers everything the Pro does, but bigger. Its screen is the same size as the iPhone 12 Pro Max: 6.7 inchesw diagonally. It, like the rest of the iPhone 13 line, is a bit heavier and thicker than its predecessor, despite sharing the same dimensions otherwise. In addition to getting a chip upgrade to the A15, the iPhone 13 Pro Max also gets an additional GPU, for a total of five. It, too, offers a 1 TB storage capacity option, and Apple says the battery is able to support up to 28 hours of non-stop video playback. With the heftiest pricetag of any iPhone, the iPhone Pro Max is the ultimate top-of-the-line model available.
