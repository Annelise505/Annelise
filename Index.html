   This was the first iphone officially announced on January 9, 2007 and released on June 29, 2007.Apple created the device during a secretive and unprecedented collaboration with Cingular Wireless, now part of AT&T. The development cost of the collaboration was estimated to have been $150 million over a thirty-month period.
   The original iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 in a keynote address at the Macworld Conference & Expo held in Moscone West in San Francisco, California.The iPhone's back cover is made out of brushed aluminum, a soft metal. The iPhone's screen is a 320x480 resolution, multi-touch screen, that measures about 3.5 inches diagonally, much bigger than other phones at the time. The rear camera on the iPhone has a resolution of 2 megapixels, and also features geotagging.
