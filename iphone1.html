The development cost of the collaboration was about $150 million in 30 months. The iPhone's back cover is made out of brushed aluminum, a soft metal. The iPhone's screen is a 320x480 resolution, multi-touch screen, that measures 3.5 inches diagonally. The rear camera on the iPhone has a resolution of 2 megapixels and features geotagging. The iPhone was released for the price of $499 for the 4 GB model and $599 for the 8 GB model. In 1984, said Jobs, Apple introduced the Macintosh and changed the computer industry. In 2001, the company introduced the iPod and changed the entire music industry. Key features include a 3.5-ince diagonal screen, 320x480 pixels at 163 ppi, and 2- megapixel camera. The original operating system for the original iPhone, iPhone OS 1, featured Visual Voicemail, multi-touch gestures, HTML email, Apple's Safari web browser, threaded text messaging, an "iPod" music and video player app, a dedicated YouTube app and a Maps app powered by Google Maps. It also included Phone/contacts, Calendar, Photos, Stocks, Weather, Clock, Calculator, Notes, and Settings apps. However, many features like MMS, apps, and copy and paste were not supported at release, leading hackers jailbreaking their phones to add these features.
